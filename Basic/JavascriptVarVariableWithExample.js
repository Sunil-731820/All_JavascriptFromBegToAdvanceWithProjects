/* 
JavaScript var statement is used to declare variables in JavaScript that are function-scoped. The var statement is also used to declare global-scope variables.

Before the introduction of ES6, all the keywords in JavaScript were declared with only the “var” keyword.

Syntax:
var variableName = valueOfVar;

Function Scope
The variables declared inside a function are function-scoped and cannot be accessed outside the function. The variables declared with var can only be accessed inside that function and its enclosing function.

The variables declared using the var statement are hoisted at the top and are initialized before the execution of code with a default value of undefined. The variables declared in the global scope that is outside any function cannot be deleted
