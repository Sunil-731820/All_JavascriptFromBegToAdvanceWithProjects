/*
Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions repeatedly until some condition evaluates and becomes false. We come across for loop which provides a brief and systematic way of writing the loop structure.

JavaScript for loop is used to iterate the elements for a fixed number of times. JavaScript for loop is used if the number of the iteration is known.

Syntax
for (statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3){
    code here...
}
Statement 1: It is the initialization of the counter. It is executed once before the execution of the code block.
Statement 2: It defines the testing condition for executing the code block
Statement 3: It is the increment or decrement of the counter & executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
