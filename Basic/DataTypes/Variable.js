/* 
JavaScript Variables are the building blocks of any programming language. In JavaScript, variables can be used to store reusable values. The values of the variables are allocated using the assignment operator(“=”).

JavaScript Identifiers
JavaScript variables must have unique names. These names are called Identifiers.

There are some basic rules to declare a variable in JavaScript:
These are case-sensitive
Can only begin with a letter, underscore(“_”) or “$” symbol
It can contain letters, numbers, underscore, or “$” symbol
A variable name cannot be a reserved keyword.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language so the type of variables is decided at runtime. Therefore there is no need to explicitly define the type of a variable. We can declare variables in JavaScript in three ways:

JavaScript var keyword
JavaScript let keyword
JavaScript const keyword 
Note: In JavaScript, variables can be declared automatically.

Syntax:
var geek = "Hello Geek"         // Declaration using var
let $ = "Welcome"                   // Declaration using let
const _example = "Gfg"       // Declaration using const  

*/

// First EXample Afre : 


var a = "Hello World"
var b = 10;
var c = 12;
var d = b + c;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
console.log(d);
