/*
JavaScript assignment operator is equal (=) which assigns the value of the right-hand operand to its left-hand operand. That is if a = b assigns the value of b to a.

The simple assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operation evaluates the assigned value. Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to assign a single value to multiple variables. See the example.

data=value
