/*
When executing JavaScript code, errors will definitely occur. These errors can occur due to a fault from the programmerâ€™s side or the input is wrong or even if there is a problem with the logic of the program.

But all errors can be solved and to do so we use five statements that will now be explained.

The try statement lets you test a block of code to check for errors.
The catch statement lets you handle the error if any are present.
The throw statement lets you make your own errors.
The finally statement lets you execute code after try and catch.  
The finally block runs regardless of the result of the try-catch block.
