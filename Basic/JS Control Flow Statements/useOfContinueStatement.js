/*
The continue statement in Javascript is used to break the iteration of the loop and follow with the next iteration. The break in the iteration is possible only when the specified condition going to occur.

The major difference between the continue and break statement is that the break statement breaks out of the loop completely while continue is used to break one statement and iterate to the next statement. 

How does the continue statement work for different loops? 

In a For loop, iteration goes to an updated expression which means the increment expression is first updated.
In a While loop, it again executes the condition.
Syntax:


continue;
