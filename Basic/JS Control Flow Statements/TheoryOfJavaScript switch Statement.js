/*

JavaScript switch statement is used to execute a block of code from multiple expressions.

JavaScript switch statement evaluates an expression. The expressionâ€™s value is compared with the values of each case in the structure. If a match is found, the related block of code is executed.

Usage of JavaScript switch statement
JavaScript switch statement is used with a break or default keyword (optional and both can be used together also).

break: This keyword is used to break out of the switch block. This stops the execution inside the code block.
default: This keyword is used to specify a piece of code if no case matches the given condition. There can be only one default keyword in a switch statement.
