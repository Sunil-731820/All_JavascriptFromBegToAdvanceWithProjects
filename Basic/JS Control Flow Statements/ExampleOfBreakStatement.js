/*
JavaScript break statement is used to terminate the execution of the loop or the switch statement when the condition is true.

In a switch, code breaks out and the execution of code is stopped. 
In a loop, it breaks out to the loop but the code after the loop is executed.
Syntax:
break;
Using Labels
A label reference can be used by the break statement to exit any JavaScript code block. Only a loop or a switch can be used with the break in the absence of a label.

break labelName;
