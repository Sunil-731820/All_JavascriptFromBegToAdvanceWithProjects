/*
What is Array in JavaScript?
JavaScript Array is a data structure that allows you to store and organize multiple values within a single variable. It is a versatile and dynamic object. It can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed i.e. the first element is accessed with an index 0, the second element with an index of 1, and so forth.
